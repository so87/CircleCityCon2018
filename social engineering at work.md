## Social engineering at work

### Office Politics are awful
* every group has politics
* bad politics is stepping on people to get to the top
* good politics are advancing ourselves.  Admitting you messed up, "ill get it right next time", and moving on

### Good things to do at work
* Figure out how people like to communicate: everyone is different
* Understand body language in the room:
  * Approval/Disagreement
  * Who people turn towards for advice/approval
  * when they want to leave/stop
* Don't rush people at work. Don't just focus on your own agenda
* Let people know they are effective and have helped
* Communication is key, especially to your boss
* Together we are doing these things. Celebrate accomplishments with them
